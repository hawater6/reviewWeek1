    <h2>Why are Glaciers melting?</h2>
    <p>
        To start off, glaciers are a level of ice that cover over the Earth and our oceans. Since the early 1900s, with the Industrial Revolution, glaciers have been melting very quickly. Other factors include carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The glaciers melting doesn't sound as big as it actually is, which is probably why people do so little to help prevent it from happening. However,if the glaciers continue to melt like they have been, global sea levels would rise and eventually flood every coastal city on the planet. So, in order for that to not happen or at least to prevent it from happening for a bit longer, there are some things we can do.
